# Analyzing-Hateful-Memes
Submission for Precog Recruitment **`Task 2:`** Analyzing Hateful Memes

The codebase has been divided into folders corresponding to the subtasks of the main task.

**`IMPORTANT`** Before you begin, you should download the Dataset from this ([Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rdxxt48MBHTHIkINuIVXeGYEFFqqrP6p?usp=drive_link)) and extract it into the main folder. If you wish to use your own dataset, feel free to do so, but make sure to follow the same directory setup as the one in the link.

## Subtask 1: Object Detection
All the codes and outputs related to this task can be found in the [object Detection](Object%20Detection) folder.

## Subtask 2: Caption Impact Assessment
All the codes and outputs related to this task can be found in the [Caption Impact Assessment](Caption%20Impact%20Assessment) folder.

**`NOTE`** The [notebook](Caption%20Impact%20Assessment/Object%20Detection%20and%20Caption%20Impact%20Assessment/objectDetectionWithoutText.ipynb) when compiled and run, outputs the meme images with their text/caption removed. In my submission, I have demonstrated the model's results by running it on [this dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sg94bSMp-pv7z8Em854kAdhdgbk4rgOB?usp=drive_link). The output for the same can be viewed in this [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GuarCer9Ui2r6jidZa6XUT77H31jr38A?usp=drive_link)
